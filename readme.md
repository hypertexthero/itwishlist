# IT Wish List

Naively-built website inspired by a well-known geek site to manage IT needs at work.

## Todo now

- Allow logins from users with details in existing separate user database
- Add 'Action Request' post status for recurring tasks
    - Add 'Responsible' and 'Observers' fields
- Refactor ranking algorythm using [the function from Drum](http://blog.jupo.org/2013/04/30/building-social-apps-with-mezzanine-drum/)

## Todo in Future (upcoming features)

- Rename URLS from 'post' to 'item'
- Port DB to MySQL for work setup
- Add [failed login blocker](https://github.com/alexkuhl/django-failedloginblocker) to mitigate brute-force attacks
- Set up fabric deployment
- Ability to vote on comments
- User karma system - users with karma above a certain threshold get new abilities such as downvotes
- Feeds & Content Export in Atom XML and JSON
- Previous/Next entry by user
