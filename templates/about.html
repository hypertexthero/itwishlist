    <h1 id="ippcitframeworksummarydiagram">About the IPPC IT Wishlist <br><span class="normal">(The IPPC IT Workflow)</span></h1>

    <p>The IPPC IT Wishlist is part of the IPPC IT Workflow, which is based on the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">principles</a> behind the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>. In summary:</p>

    <ol>
    <li><p>The IPPC IT Framework uses the real-world progress of a project to plan and schedule deadlines, instead of a best guess or uninformed forecast. In The IPPC IT Framework, projects are divided into specific work phases, known as sprints, which last usually 2, to a maximum of 4 weeks.</p></li>
    <li><p>At the end of each sprint, people who have an interest in the outcome of the project (IPPC Secretariat Colleagues, etc) and IT Team Members meet to assess the progress of a project. This allows a project’s direction to be changed based on completed work, not speculation or predictions.</p></li>
    <li><p>One of the things The IPPC IT Framework assumes is that someone has a vision of what the team is going to accomplish together and that their vision is important enough that someone has given them money to accomplish it. </p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Below is a rough description of the process.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Product Owner - IPPC Core Team (ideally with one person as overall leader)</li>
    <li>IT Team Coach - Simon</li>
    <li>IT Team Members - Paola, Peter, Simon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id=".wishlistspanclassnormalrequirementsdocumentmanagementandsupporttool-listofstuffthatneedstogetdonefromabusinessperspectivetogetippcsvisionaccomplishedspan-it.ippc.inthttp:it.ippc.int">1. Wish List <span class="normal">(requirements document, management and support tool) - list of stuff that needs to get done from a business perspective to get IPPC’s vision accomplished</span> - <a href="http://it.ippc.int">it.ippc.int</a></h2>

    <ul>
    <li>The person who creates the wish list is the product owner, who is from the business, knows what the product is supposed to do, business goals we are trying to achieve with it.</li>
    <li>Product owner uses Wish List as a heat shield between the IT Team and rest of Secretariat Staff.</li>
    <li>The list is prioritized. Highest business value items go on top. Items on the list can be voted on, one vote per user in Secretariat. Product Owner/Core Team ultimately decide what is top priority.</li>
    <li>The wish list also (may potentially) be used as a support tool like the current trouble ticket system (create Bug Reports instead of New Feature Request).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Request Type</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>New Feature Request</li>
        <li>Bug Report</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Status (needed??)</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>In Progress</li>
        <li>Done</li>
        <li>Wait</li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>Priority (needed??)</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Urgent</li>
        <li>Normal</li>
        <li>Low</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id=".sprintplanningsprintliststandupmeetings">2. Sprint Planning, Sprint List, Standup Meetings</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Product owner, helped by IT Team Coach, does Sprint Planning:
    <ol>
    <li>First thing to do is decide how long the sprint will be. <strong>Never longer than 4 weeks</strong>, because after 4 weeks things get sloppy. IPPC IT can make solid plans for one month.</li>
    <li>Knowing the timeline and capacity of the team, the Product Owner, IT Team Coach and IT Team Members discuss and agree on what work to commit to doing in this timeline, and choose what items from the Wish List to put into current…</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>…Sprint List</strong> - While the IT Team is working on their current Sprint List, other people cannot come in and ask them to do other stuff. If there’s something earth-shattering, they never need to wait longer than 4 weeks.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><p>Current IT Sprint list items, deadline and date for next Sprint Review meeting is posted to the IT Status Log at <a href="http://it.ippc.int/log">it.ippc.int/log</a> so everyone can keep track.</p></li>
    <li><p>Every 24 hours IT Team and Team Coach have a short Standup Meeting where they say:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>This is what I did yesterday</li>
    <li>This is what I want to do today</li>
    <li>This is what’s on my way
    <ul>
    <li><strong>IT Team Coach’s job is to get things out of rest of team’s way.</strong> Four weeks is not a long time, no time to set up other meetings. If an IT Team Member brings up a problem, it needs to be knocked down by the IT Team Coach, especially if it is outside the team.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ol></li>
    <li><p>At end of sprint we have a potentially shippable product or feature — this is GREAT! The stuff that team put in the Sprint List is DONE and available for testing in <a href="http://test.ippc.int">test.ippc.int</a>. We can put in in production tomorrow if necessary.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id=".sprintreviewproductinspection-whatwecreated">3. Sprint Review (product inspection - WHAT we created)</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Bring rest of Secretariat in for Sprint Review meeting facilitated by Donatella.</li>
    <li>Show and tell - here’s what we committed to in beginning of sprint, and here it is.</li>
    <li>This way everyone can see what the progress is.</li>
    <li>Secretariat can now test what was created and give feedback in comments on the IPPC IT Log at <strong>it.ippc.int/log/yyyy-mm-dd-sprint-review-title</strong> (log is not ready yeat)</li>
    <li>New ideas, feature requests and bugs go into the Wish List at it.ippc.int</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id=".retrospectiveprocessinspection-howwecreatedit">4. Retrospective (process inspection - HOW we created it)</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Only IT Team Members, IT Team Coach, and, if necessary Coordinator and Donatella, meet.</li>
    <li>Lessons learned, with a purpose:
    <ol>
    <li>What went well</li>
    <li>What didn’t go so well</li>
    <li>One, two or three agreements on what we will change for the next sprint</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Repeat!</p>
